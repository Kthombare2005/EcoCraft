ðŸŒ¿ EcoCraft â€“ Transforming Scrap into Treasure
EcoCraft is a platform that enables users to sell their scrap or repurpose it into valuable creations. By connecting individuals with scrap buyers, we aim to promote sustainability and reduce waste. The project features a seller dashboard, a modern Gen Z-inspired UI with Bootstrap, and a scraper list to help users find nearby buyers based on location and scrap details.
